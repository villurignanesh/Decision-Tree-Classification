# Decision-Tree-Classification
This project the implemention of the Decision Tree Induction algorithm for classification using python on 15 benchmark datasets. We have given a full description
of our implementation, Three metrics (Information Gain, Gain Ratio and Gini Index), as well as a simple illustrative example, to validate our results and outcomes from using large benchmark datasets. We also incorporated the algorithm's performance based on the efficient use of computer memory and execution time across huge test datasets.
